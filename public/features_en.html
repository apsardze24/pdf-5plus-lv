        <h1>The Ultimate All-in-One Visual Toolkit: Free, Private, and In Your Browser</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the most versatile and privacy-respecting online tool for all your document and image needs. Whether you're signing a contract, annotating a report, or creating icons, our application provides a suite of powerful tools without ever needing to upload your files to a server. Everything happens right here, in your browser.</p>

        <h2>Powerful PDF & Image Editor</h2>
        <p>Go beyond simple image cropping. Our full-featured editor turns your browser into a creative canvas for both images and PDF documents. It's the perfect tool for signing documents, filling forms, and making quick annotations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sign PDF Documents Online:</strong> Easily add your signature to any PDF or image. Draw your signature directly on the screen or upload an existing one to sign contracts, agreements, and forms in seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill & Annotate PDF Forms:</strong> Open multi-page PDF documents and edit them page by page. Add text to fill out forms, or use shapes and drawing tools to annotate and highlight important sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Based Editing:</strong> Every element you add—be it a line drawn with the pen, a shape, text, or a signature—is an independent object. Select, move, resize, rotate, and delete any element at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Drawing Tools:</strong> Use the <strong>Pen tool</strong> for freehand drawing or the <strong>Eraser tool</strong> for corrections. Both tools feature a full color palette, an <strong>Eyedropper</strong> to pick colors directly from the document, and adjustable thickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Annotation Shapes:</strong> Add <strong>Arrows</strong>, <strong>Rectangles</strong>, and <strong>Circles</strong> to draw attention to key areas. Customize their color, thickness, and transparency.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Navigation:</strong> The <strong>Hand tool</strong> allows you to effortlessly pan around the document, while the mouse wheel lets you zoom in and out for pixel-perfect precision. Canvas movement is automatically disabled when a drawing tool is active to prevent mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Quickly <strong>Flip</strong> your images horizontally or vertically, and access a powerful <strong>Crop & Resize</strong> tool for exact dimensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Professional Icon Generator</h2>
        <p>Stop resizing images one by one. Our Icon Generator takes a single source image and instantly creates a complete set of icons for any platform, saving you hours of tedious work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-configured Profiles:</strong> Get all the sizes you need with one click for <strong>Favicon/Website</strong>, <strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</strong>, and <strong>Chrome Extensions</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Sizes:</strong> Need a specific dimension? Simply enter any width and height to generate icons tailored to your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Ready-to-Use Zip Files:</strong> Download a single, organized <code>.zip</code> file containing all your generated icons, and for some profiles, even the necessary manifest files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Versatile Image Converter</h2>
        <p>Convert images between the most popular web formats quickly and efficiently. Our converter is built for both single-file adjustments and large batch operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Formats:</strong> Convert to and from <strong>PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, GIF</strong>. You can even convert images into a <strong>PDF</strong> document.</li>
            <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Drag and drop up to 30 images at once to convert them all to your desired format in a single operation.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF to Image:</strong> Upload a PDF and convert its pages into high-quality JPG or PNG images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Custom QR Code Generator</h2>
