        <h1>The Ultimate All-in-One Visual Toolkit: Free, Private, and In Your Browser</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the most versatile and privacy-respecting online tool for all your visual content needs. Whether you're a developer, designer, marketer, or just someone looking to quickly edit a photo, our application provides a suite of powerful tools without ever needing to upload your files to a server. Everything happens right here, in your browser.</p>

        <h2>Powerful Image & PDF Editor</h2>
        <p>Go beyond simple cropping. Our full-featured editor turns your browser into a creative canvas for images and PDF documents. It's the perfect tool for quick annotations, corrections, and creative compositions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive PDF Support:</strong> Open multi-page PDF documents and edit them page by page. Add signatures, text, and annotations to contracts, forms, and reports with ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Drawing Tools:</strong> Use the <strong>Pen tool</strong> for freehand drawing or the <strong>Eraser tool</strong> for corrections. Both tools feature a full color palette, an <strong>Eyedropper</strong> to pick colors directly from the image, and adjustable thickness.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Based Editing:</strong> Every element you add—be it a line drawn with the pen, a shape, or text—is an independent object. Select, move, resize, rotate, and delete any element at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Sign Documents Digitally:</strong> Add your signature by drawing it on our signature pad or by uploading an image of your existing signature. Place it anywhere on your images or PDF pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Annotation Tools:</strong> Add <strong>Arrows</strong>, <strong>Rectangles</strong>, and <strong>Circles</strong> to highlight important areas. Customize their color, thickness, and transparency.</li>
            <li><strong>Text Tool:</strong> Insert text with full control over font family, size, and color. Perfect for watermarking or adding captions.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Navigation:</strong> The <strong>Hand tool</strong> allows you to effortlessly pan around the canvas, while the mouse wheel lets you zoom in and out for pixel-perfect precision. Canvas movement is automatically disabled when a drawing tool is active to prevent mistakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Quickly <strong>Flip</strong> your images horizontally or vertically, and access a powerful <strong>Crop & Resize</strong> tool for exact dimensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Professional Icon Generator</h2>
        <p>Stop resizing images one by one. Our Icon Generator takes a single source image and instantly creates a complete set of icons for any platform, saving you hours of tedious work.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-configured Profiles:</strong> Get all the sizes you need with one click for <strong>Favicon/Website</strong>, <strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</strong>, and <strong>Chrome Extensions</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Sizes:</strong> Need a specific dimension? Simply enter any width and height to generate icons tailored to your project.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Cropping:</strong> Start with a perfectly centered square crop or use the entire image as your source.</li>
            <li><strong>Ready-to-Use Zip Files:</strong> Download a single, organized <code>.zip</code> file containing all your generated icons, and for some profiles, even the necessary manifest files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Versatile Image Converter</h2>
        <p>Convert images between the most popular web formats quickly and efficiently. Our converter is built for both single-file adjustments and large batch operations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Formats:</strong> Convert to and from <strong>PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, GIF</strong>. You can even convert images into a <strong>PDF</strong> document.</li>
            <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Drag and drop up to 30 images at once to convert them all to your desired format in a single operation.</li>
            <li><strong>PDF to Image:</strong> Upload a PDF and convert its pages into high-quality JPG or PNG images.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Editing:</strong> When working with a single image, you can access the editor to resize or make adjustments before converting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Custom QR Code Generator</h2>
        <p>Make your QR codes stand out from the crowd. Our generator lets you create beautiful, branded, and highly functional QR codes that capture attention and invite scans.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Design Control:</strong> Customize the color of the <strong>dots, corners, and background</strong>. Choose from various styles for both the dots and corners to match your brand's aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Your Logo:</strong> Upload your company logo or any other image to be placed in the center of the QR code.</li>
            <li><strong>Include a Caption:</strong> Add a short, readable text caption directly below your QR code—perfect for a call-to-action or a brief description.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Data Types:</strong> Create QR codes for URLs, plain text, vCard contacts, Wi-Fi network credentials, calendar events, geographical locations, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Resolution Export:</strong> Download your final QR code as a high-quality <strong>PNG</strong> (at various sizes) or a scalable <strong>SVG</strong> vector file.</li>
        </ul>
